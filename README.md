# Valorant-Kill-Predictor
Building a linear regression model using Python scikit-learn(tensor flow for the new model) to predict player kills in Valorant matches.

# Part 1 
In the folder "Model with limited data" I built a fairly simple model using pre-scraped data off kaggle. I realized I need a lot more data to build a good model, so in the new folder "Official Project" I will be working on the new part of the project.

# Part 2 
In this new part, the goal will be to create a little program or website where you plug in the players name, and team they are versing. This will then be plugged into a webscraper to gather all data possible from vlr.gg which has every single pro match from every single pro player. This new data will be used to make a more accurate prediction. I will be building the model with tensor flow this time.

-Updates:
Input gets sent to main then sent to scraper but its not being returned somewhere
Being scraping data with user input
