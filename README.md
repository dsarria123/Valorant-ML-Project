# Valorant-Kill-Predictor
Building a linear regression model using Python scikit-learn(tensor flow for the new model) to predict player kills in Valorant matches.
The goal will be to create a little program or website where you plug in the players name, and team they are versing. This will then be plugged into a webscraper to gather all data possible from vlr.gg which has every single pro match from every single pro player. This data will be used to make a more accurate prediction. I will be building the model using tensor flow.

# Web Scraping DONE
Build webscraper that extracts the players statistics from all his recorded matches on vlr.gg.
- Methods used: MatchScraper.py, Table Scraper.py, getPlayerName.py, 

# Cleaning, feature engineering, and building the model. DONE
Done for what I think I can do with this data, maybe will continue in the future.
